%% This script retrain the LMMSE algorithm from a dataset of images
% A small dataset of 3 images is provided as a demonstration. 
% Please use the same image structure as in Data/Dataset if you want to
% retrain with your own dataset.
% At the end of this Script, you will find the new trained D matrix in
% folder "Data".
